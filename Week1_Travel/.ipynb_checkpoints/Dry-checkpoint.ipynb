    "This week, we'll explore the built-in data types, seeing how we can store information in them, and then extract information from them, without having to create a new class.\n",

    "I want you to create two different functions, collect_places and display_places.  Neither function takes an argument; instead, they will both work with a global variable, \"visits\".  (I'm purposely keeping quiet about my preferred type for \"visits\", so that you can think about it a bit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we want to organize a list of places to which someone has traveled. That is: We'll ask the user to enter, one at a time, a city and country to which they have traveled. The city and country should be separated by a comma. If there is no comma, then the user is given an error message, and given another chance. If the user enters a city-country combination, then this information is recorded, and then they're asked again.  Indeed, the user is asked again and again for a city-state combination, until they provide an empty response. When that happens, the questioning phase ends, and the reporting phase begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the report, we'll want to see a list of all of the places visited, organized by country. That is, we'll get a list of the visited countries, presented in alphabetical order, and for each country, we'll see a list of visited cities, also in alphabetical order.  If the city was visited more than once, then we'll see a number next to its name.\n",
